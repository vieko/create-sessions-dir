Create or update documentation for a specific topic in .sessions/docs/

The user will provide a topic name (e.g., "authentication", "api-design", "testing-strategy").

Steps:
1. If .sessions/docs/ doesn't exist, create it first
2. Create or update .sessions/docs/<topic>.md
3. Ask me what should be documented about this topic
4. Structure the documentation with:
   - Overview of the topic
   - Current decisions and rationale
   - Implementation details or patterns
   - Open questions or considerations
   - Links to relevant code or resources

Keep the documentation scannable and focused. Use clear headings and bullet points.
