description: Archive completed session work
---

**First**: Find the git root to locate session files (supports monorepos):
- Run: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to get the repository root path
- Session files live at `<git-root>/.sessions/`

Review completed work in `<git-root>/.sessions/` and archive it.

Move finished session notes to `<git-root>/.sessions/archive/` organized by date or topic.
Clean up `<git-root>/.sessions/index.md` by removing completed items.
