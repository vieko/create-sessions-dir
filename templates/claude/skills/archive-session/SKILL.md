# Archive Session Awareness

This skill detects when session work may be ready for archiving and suggests the appropriate action.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger when:
- User asks to merge: "merge it", "merge the PR", "go ahead and merge", "ship it"
- After you successfully run `gh pr merge`
- User mentions completion: "PR merged", "shipped", "done with X", "finished"
- User references merged state: "merged to main", "closed the issue"

## Instructions

1. If user asks to merge a PR:
   - Perform the merge as requested
   - On success, continue to step 2
   - On failure, help resolve the issue (don't suggest archiving)

2. After a successful merge, read `.sessions/index.md` to assess work state

3. If user provided a PR URL/number (or you just merged one), verify:
   ```
   gh pr view [URL/number] --json state,mergedAt,title
   ```

4. Assess if work appears complete:
   - PR merged?
   - Related tasks marked done in session notes?
   - No obvious follow-up work mentioned?

5. If work appears complete, suggest archiving:
   > "PR merged successfully. This session's work looks complete - want me to archive it?
   > Run `/archive-session` to move completed work to the archive."

6. If there's more work in the session:
   > "PR merged. I see there's still [X, Y] in the session notes - want to continue
   > with those or archive what's done so far?"

## Important

- This skill **suggests** archiving, it does NOT archive automatically
- User must explicitly run `/archive-session` to perform the archive
- Trigger AFTER merge succeeds, not before
- Multiple PRs may be part of one logical session - check context
